<p>Last year i took part in Facebook hacker cup 2012. There were three brain storming questions presented and solving any one of them would qualify me but i was quite unlucky as i couldn&#8217;t pass through the qualification round.</p>

<p>The problem i tried solving was Alphabet soup.</p>

<h2 id='alphabet_soup'>Alphabet Soup</h2>

<p>Alfredo Spaghetti really likes soup,especially when it contains alphabet pasta. Every day he constructs a sentence from letters, places the letters into a bowl of broth and enjoys delicious alphabet soup.</p>

<p>Today, after constructing the sentence, Alfredo remembered that the Facebook Hacker Cup starts today! Thus, he decided to construct the phrase &#8220;HACKERCUP&#8221;. As he already added the letters to the broth, he is stuck with the letters he originally selected. Help Alfredo determine how many times he can place the word &#8220;HACKERCUP&#8221; side-by-side using the letters in his soup.</p>

<h2 id='input'>Input</h2>

<p>The first line of the input file contains a single integer T: the number of test cases. T lines follow, each representing a single test case with a sequence of upper-case letters and spaces: the original sentence Alfredo constructed.</p>

<h2 id='output'>Output</h2>

<p>Output T lines, one for each test case. For each case, output &#8220;Case #t: n&#8221;, where t is the test case number (starting from 1) and n is the number of times the word &#8220;HACKERCUP&#8221; can be placed side-by-side using the letters from the sentence.</p>

<h2 id='constraints'>Constraints</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 &lt; T â‰¤ 20</li>

<li>Sentences contain only the upper-case letters A-Z and the space character</li>

<li>Each sentence contains at least one letter, and contains at most 1000 characters, including spaces</li>
</ul>
