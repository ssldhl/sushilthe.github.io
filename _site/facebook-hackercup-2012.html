<p>Last year, I took part in Facebook hacker cup 2012. There were three brain storming questions presented and solving any one of them would qualify me but i was quite unlucky as i couldn&#8217;t pass through the qualification round.</p>

<p>The problem that i tried solving was <a href='/assets/files/alphabet-soup/alphabet-soup.pdf'>Alphabet soup</a> where i was provided with the <a href='/assets/files/alphabet-soup/alphabet_soup.txt'>file</a> to check whether my program would produce the correct result. The result was to be submitted within six minutes time-frame and any programming language could be used so i used the c programming language. The program i had written to solve the problem was: <script src='https://gist.github.com/931.js?file=c1c8d465a04042403'> </script></p>

<p>This program produced the <a href='/assets/files/alphabet-soup/output-bad.txt'>output</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, i was not able to proceed as my program was incorrect. The possible reason is that i have used string of length 1000 which can only hold 999 characters and the loop for(i=0;i&lt;=7;i++) has no sense as the maximum number that hold[] can handle is 6. So, probably the right solution would be: <script src='https://gist.github.com/6103050.js'> </script></p>

<p>This program produced the <a href='/assets/files/alphabet-soup/output-correct.txt'>output</a>, which was the correct output.</p>
