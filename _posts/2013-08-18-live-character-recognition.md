##Texts from Image

![Live! Character Recognition](/assets/images/lcr.png "Live Character Recognition image")

Live! Character Recognition was my minor project in which a web camera when held above the image with texts buried in it would give the text as an output. The project was done in Java Programming language.

The processing of the image was based on [Multi-scale edge based text extraction system](http://cecs.uci.edu/~papers/icme06/pdfs/0001721.pdf "Image Processing algorithm"), where image is first scaled and then superimposed to get the desired effect. All the detail explanation of how the project was made can be found in this [report]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/live-character-recognition/lcr.pdf).

The project was very difficult for me. I had no previous knowledge about image processing and i had never worked in java. Besides these difficulties, the project was completed and i learned a lot about the software development life cycle and the image processing.

The incomplete and ugly code can be found at: [Github](https://github.com/sushilthe/live_character_recognition "Live Character Recognition source")
