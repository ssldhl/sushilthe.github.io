#An interest to build bots

From the begining of my engineering studies i was very interested in building robots esp. those which had wheels and could move. At the second part of my first year in engineering, i along with the support of some my mates were able to build a simple line tracking robot and stood first in the competition held between first years.

This incident filled me with a passion to built a [line maze solver]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/line-maze-solver/lms.pdf). I started to build this robot after i bought a Arduino Duemilanove 328 from the store as a hobby and later on when a national level competition called LOCUS was going to be held, where people from all around the country participate to win the hardware competition, some of my friends helped me in completing the robot. Though we could not win the competition(because of all those messy wires and other stuffs), we were ready to tackle next competition.

Later, my study in computer field couldn't provide me with enough time to do these kinds of stuffs but still today i like robots and electronics and i hope someday when i complete my study i will make another more intelligent and more powerful robot.
